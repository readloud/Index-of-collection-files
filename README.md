The Crusty Windows project is dedicated to preserving bootlegged Windows, Linux, and DOS ISOs.

These ISOs are getting harder and harder to find as file sharing websites close down and delete old files, 
so this project was created by modeco80, Dartz, and CHOCOLATEMAN to preserve these works and prevent them 
from disappearing off the internet.

This collection is organized by their base Windows release, or "Linux" for Linux bootlegs, so you can find
what you're looking for easier.

We also have a wiki that documents these OSes: https://crustywindo.ws/Main_Page 

Some of our most notable finds include:
- Bob Pony OS 1, 2
- Windows 7 Angry Birds Edition
- Windows 7 FacebooK Edition 2012
- Windows 7 Infinium Edition
- Windows 8 Green Edition
- Windows 10 Dota Edition
- Windows 10 Gamer Edition
- Windows 10 YuGiOh Edition
- Windows Vista Eternity 2009
- Windows XP DisneyLand Edition
- Windows XP Ganja Edition
- Windows XP Genius Edition 2010
- Windows XP XRAYMAN Edition
  
...and many more you won't find anywhere else on the net!

Our collection is over 900 GB in size, and is growing with each addition.

NOTICE: The Crusty Windows project does not condone piracy. Please do not use these ISOs for illegal purposes.
Thank You!
